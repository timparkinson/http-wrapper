# http-wrapper
Wrap powershell functions for use as a web service.

## Why re-invent the wheel?

I'm deliberately trying to get away with the minimum possible for my use case and going to make this very heavily opinionated. I'll be borrowing heavily from, but simplifying https://github.com/timparkinson/posh-httpd. I have taken other approaches in the past (DSL + Code generator for running powershell under http://nancyfx.org/).
